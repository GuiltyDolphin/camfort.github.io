  <p>
The need for more rigorous software verification in computational
science is well known. Often the responsibility is placed on the
scientist, but increased care and attention is not enough. There is a wealth of research in computer science
aimed at automating testing and verification, yet little of this has crossed
over into practice in the sciences.
</p>

<p>
This meeting provides a forum to discuss recent work and 
new ideas, and to foster links between researchers 
interested in the intersection of verification, programming languages, and
computational science. The meeting is aimed at both computer scientists
and natural/physical scientists employing computational techniques.

<p>
The meeting will last the afternoon at the Computer Laboratory,
University of Cambridge, followed by dinner. The meeting
is part of the EPSRC project <a href="http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/M026124/1"><i>CamFort: Automated evolution and verification of computational science models</i></a>
at the Computer Laboratory.

  <h3>Keynote</h3>

  We are very pleased to have <a
  href="http://dirac.cnrs-orleans.fr/plone/Members/hinsen">Konrad
  Hinsen</a> from the Centre de Biophysique Moléculaire in Orléans,
  France giving our keynote this year:

  <blockquote>
  <h4 style="margin-top:0px">The long road from ideas to bits and back: a traveller's guide to verifiable computational research</h4>

  The translation of a scientific question into bit patterns in a
  computer's memory involves many steps, as does the back-translation
  of the results of a computation into scientific insight. Each step
  is a potential source of mistakes, and thus requires some form of
  verification before we can trust its correctness. In this talk, I
  will outline appropriate verification approaches for each step,
  which range from purely human efforts, in particular the critical
  inspection of formulas and program source code, to fully mechanical
  procedures such as type or unit checking. I will also adopt a
  long-term perspective, focussing on the tools, procedures, and
  teaching curricula that we ought to develop in order to establish a
  trustworthy verification chain for computational science, even if
  they require a change of habits compared to today's state of the
  art. In particular, I will argue for the necessity to develop
  digital scientific notations as the main human-computer interface of
  computer-aided research.<br />
  
In the course of this discussion, I will also try to shed some light
  on a few long-standing mysteries in computational science: Why is
  testing floating-point code so difficult? Why is it so hard to make
  scientific computations reproducible?  Why is there less use of
  static type checking in science, despite it being considered
  evidently beneficial in computer science?  Why do we trust
  computations uncritically, even though we witness the unreliability
of computing technology in daily life?

  <h3>Attending and contributing</h3>

  If you would like to attend, <b>please register
  by March 1<sup>st</sup> via <a
  href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc9xdKid9NtrqIkU-okLARMQ-9TY-x2imhEGxwTdEbCgH1l3g/viewform">the
  registration form</a></b>.
  <br /><br />
  Registration is free. We plan to go for dinner afterward, though it
  is not yet clear whether this can be provided for free.
  <br /><br />
  We invite proposals for talks of 20 minutes on topics relevant
  to the theme of the workshop. Please register your interest in
  giving a talk with the <a
  href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc9xdKid9NtrqIkU-okLARMQ-9TY-x2imhEGxwTdEbCgH1l3g/viewform">registration
  form</a>. Depending
on the number of submitted talks we may select a subset based
  on relevance and to gain a broad perspective. We also solicit
  lightning talks (5 minutes) on practice/experience of testing
  and verification in science. You may propose both a 20 minute talk
  and lightning talk.
  </p>
  
<!--
<p>
<h3>Talks</h3>

We also invite proposals for talks of between 20 and 30 minutes
on topics relevant to the theme of the workshop. Please submit
a talk abstract (up to 500 words) to <a
href="mailto:dominic.orchard@cl.cam.ac.uk">dominic.orchard@cl.cam.ac.uk</a>. Depending
on the number of submitted talks we may have to select a subset based
on relevance and to gain a broad perspective. Please submit talk abstracts
by <span class="important">February 29th</span> at the latest.

<h3>Logistics</h3>

The <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk">Computer Laboratory</a> is
situated on the west side of Cambridge (<a
href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/University+of+Cambridge+Computer+Laboratory/@52.2108943,0.089538,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47d8774a3f6e55cd:0xabf8227343e684c7?hl=en"><b>map</b></a>)
and is most easily accessed from the Cambridge train station by taking
a taxi or the Uni 4 bus. Cambridge is easily accessible by train from London King Cross.
Please contact us if you have any questions. <br /><br />

<!--
The meeting will be held in <a
href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/openroommap/static/?s=FW26&labels=1"><b>room
FW26</b> (click for map)</a> which is on the first floor to the right
of the stairs on the west side of the building. We
will post signage on the day, but you can enter at reception and ask
to be directed. <br /><br />
-->

For those looking for lunch first, there is a cafe directly below the
meeting room, as well as <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/misc/localarea/catering.html">other options on the West
Cambridge campus</a>.<br /><br />
