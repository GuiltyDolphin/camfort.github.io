        <p>
          The need for more rigorous software verification in computational
          science is well known. Often the responsibility is placed on the
          scientist, but increased care and attention is not enough. There is a wealth of research in computer science
          aimed at automating testing and verification, yet little of this has crossed
          over into practice in the sciences.
        </p>

        <p>
          This meeting provides a forum to discuss recent work and
          new ideas, and to foster links between researchers
          interested in the intersection of verification, programming languages, and
          computational science. The meeting is aimed at both computer scientists
          and natural/physical scientists employing computational techniques.

            The long road from ideas to bits and back: a traveller's guide to verifiable computational research
          </span>
          <div class="abstract">
            <p>The translation of a scientific question into bit patterns in a
            computer's memory involves many steps, as does the back-translation
            of the results of a computation into scientific insight. Each step
            is a potential source of mistakes, and thus requires some form of
            verification before we can trust its correctness. In this talk, I
            will outline appropriate verification approaches for each step,
            which range from purely human efforts, in particular the critical
            inspection of formulas and program source code, to fully mechanical
            procedures such as type or unit checking. I will also adopt a
            long-term perspective, focussing on the tools, procedures, and
            teaching curricula that we ought to develop in order to establish a
            trustworthy verification chain for computational science, even if
            they require a change of habits compared to today's state of the
            art. In particular, I will argue for the necessity to develop
            digital scientific notations as the main human-computer interface of
            computer-aided research.</p>

            <p>In the course of this discussion, I will also try to shed some light
            on a few long-standing mysteries in computational science: Why is
            testing floating-point code so difficult? Why is it so hard to make
            scientific computations reproducible?  Why is there less use of
            static type checking in science, despite it being considered
            evidently beneficial in computer science?  Why do we trust
            computations uncritically, even though we witness the unreliability
            of computing technology in daily life?</p>

            <p>
              Manually reasoning about programs using floating point can be
              difficult. In this talk I'll walk through some examples of
              seemingly correct code and show how a program analysis technique
              called symbolic execution can be used to expose correctness
              problems.

            How to do virtually everything with the Met Office Unified Model
          </span>
          <div class="abstract">
            <p>
              The Met Office Unified Model (MetUM) is a state of the art
              general circulation model that has many different scientific
              settings. Ensuring that the code is well tested is essential, as
              it is used operationally worldwide, e.g. for weather &amp;
              air-quality forecasts.
            </p>

            <p>
              With over 900,000 lines of code and over 200 active developers
              on four continents, a comprehensive test harness is in place at
              the Met Office and partner sites to aid in development. However,
              what is available for UK academics and their groups, who wish to
              contribute to MetUM development, but do not have access to these
              resources?
            </p>

            <p>
              This talk will discuss the recent developments made by the Met
              Office in running the MetUM in a virtual machine environment. I
              will cover using this environment for testing and training, and
              will give examples of the problems encountered, along with some
              solutions.

          <div class="abstract">
            <p>
              Modern control is implemented with digital microcontrollers,
              embedded within a dynamical plant that represents physical
              components. I present a new algorithm based on counter-example
              guided inductive synthesis that automates the design of digital
              controllers that are correct by construction.  The synthesis
              result is sound with respect to the complete range of
              approximations, including time discretization, quantization
              effects, and finite-precision arithmetic and its rounding
              errors. The new algorithm is implemented in a toolbox and
              tested.

            <p>
              The development of cancer is a multistep process, driven the
              sequential acquisition of genomic alterations that transform
              cellular phenotype. The quantification of the effects of genetic
              and epigenetic on cellular dynamics is essential to understand
              the early stages in cancer evolution.  A simple stochastic model
              captures the behaviour of stem cells in squamous epithelia in
              lineage tracing experiments. Here we discuss fundamental
              limitations of experimental analysis using this model arising
              from intrinsic properties of the model, and their implications
              for future studies of transformed stem cells.

            Verification of Fortran Codes
          </span>
          <div class="abstract">
            <p>
              Fortran is a popular language for computational science codes
              which typically run on large supercomputers. With the advent of
              large Petascale machines, there is a strong emphasis on parallel
              scalability and energy efficiency. However, knowledge of
              verification of Fortran codes is lacking and there is anecdotal
              evidence to suggest that there is an over-reliance compilers to
              verify codes. This presentation will introduce a simple
              verification workflow and present the NAG compiler and
              verification tools for Fortran codes.

            Verifying spatial properties of stencil computations
          </span>

          <div class="abstract">
            <p>
              Stencil computation is a ubiquitous programming idiom in
              scientific computing. It involves iterated assignments to an
              array from some combination of the values in the neighbourhood
              of the current indices of an iteration e.g. a[i][j] = a[i][j+1]
              + a[i][j-1] in a nested loop with i and j as induction
              variables. These are heavily used in scientific simulations as
              well as image processing algorithms.
            </p>

            <p>
              The indexing behaviour may easily involve more than 10 terms
              indexing in two or three dimensions. This opens room for errors
              in offsets. We hypothesised that vast majority of stencil
              computations involve continuous and symmetrical offsets from
              induction variables. We present a succinct specification
              language that allows verifying such spatial properties.
